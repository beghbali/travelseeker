            p I moved to LA after finishing law school have lived here for 3 years. The city has endless neighborhoods to explore, diverse ethnic cuisine, and - surprise! - you don't need a car to get everywhere.
            p Downtown LA is on the upswing of a fantastic Renaissance, and it is exploding with bars, art galleries, and artesinal food. And Main Street in Santa Monica, coupled with the beach, and Venice canals is also amazing for a stroll.

            p The food scene is great here, the Nordic style cooking has really taken off the past 10 years, with Noma (the worlds best restaurant) heading the pack.

            p Summer in Copenhagen is great and there is always a lot of events during June - August.
